# kdtree-java-cpp

Added main function for java project and increased the readability- readibility.
The entry point to java project is KDFC_ART.java file. 
There, I have included the example in main function that a sample data-set of random vectors and searches nearest neighbor of another randomly generated query point. 
The example is self-explanotary. The functioning is: The method takes a data-set, creates KD-tree based index and then performs nearest neighbor query. 
In fact KD-tree does not returns the nearest neighbor, instead, it returns the distance of nearest neighbor. (Which is enough in our casse).
